# Projectile Motion Simulation

This Python script simulates the trajectory of a projectile in a 2D space using Euler's method. The simulation takes into account the initial position, velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration.

## Features

- **Projectile Motion Simulation:** The script uses Euler's method to simulate the projectile's motion over time, considering both horizontal and vertical components of velocity.

- **Visualization:** The resulting trajectory is plotted using Matplotlib, providing a visual representation of the projectile's path.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/projectile-motion-simulation.git
   cd projectile-motion-simulation
Run the Script:

`python projectile_simulation.py`
Follow the on-screen prompts to input initial conditions such as initial position, velocity, launch angle, time step, and total simulation time.

## View the Trajectory:
The script will generate a plot illustrating the projectile's trajectory.

# Parameters
Initial Position (X, Y): The starting point of the projectile in a 2D space.

Initial Velocity: The magnitude of the initial velocity of the projectile.

Launch Angle: The angle at which the projectile is launched with respect to the horizontal axis.

Delta Time: The time step used in Euler's method for numerical integration.

Total Simulation Time: The overall duration of the simulation.
